Live coding projects for BSc Computing for Games

## Controls

* WASD - control motorbike
* SPACE - rgb split effect
* P - pixel effect
* T - ghost
* R - reset effects
* Y - unlock camera
* ARROWKEYS/MOUSE - move camera when unlocked

## Portfolio pitch
The graphics project that I intend to create will be a small endless road game. The player will control a motorbike and will drive down an endless road while dodging oncoming cars. If the player hits a car their motorbike will turn into a ghost(transparency) signifying that they have lost and must reset.

The aesthetic of the game will be inspired from retro wave art style and will also have glitch effects.

Graphical and simulation techniques:
* Rendering of semi-transparent materials – ghost effect
* Physics engine – for collision with cars
* Retro wave style shader
* Glitch effect

This project will involve engagement from the user while they play the game
